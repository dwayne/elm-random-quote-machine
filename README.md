# Random Quote Machine Tutorial

This tutorial teaches you how to build the
[Random Quote Machine](https://github.com/elm-school/random-quote-machine/)
web app in Elm.

## Prerequisites

1. You have Elm installed or you can
[follow these instructions](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html)
to install Elm.
2. You have read [the Elm guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/).

## The 10,000 foot view

You will start from scratch and in six short steps you will learn how to
structure the app using HTML, how to style the app using CSS and how to add
interactivity using Elm.

In addition, you will gain experience working with
[randomness](https://guide.elm-lang.org/effects/random.html),
[JSON decoders](https://guide.elm-lang.org/effects/json.html),
[HTTP](https://guide.elm-lang.org/effects/http.html) and
[flags](https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/flags.html).

Here's what you will do in each of the six steps:

1. You will structure the app using HTML.
2. You will style the app using CSS.
3. You will port the HTML you wrote in step 1 to its equivalent in Elm.
4. You will refactor the Elm code by extracting useful functions and adding
a new type.
5. You will make the "New quote" button work.
6. You will fetch quotations from a remote source, whose URL you will specify
via a flag, when the app is initially loaded.
