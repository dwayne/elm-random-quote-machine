# Introduction

This guide will use the Random Quote Machine project to show you a way, my way, of building a web application using [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/).

## What is the Random Quote Machine project?

[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) has a [Front End Development Libraries Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries) that helps you level up your skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To earn the certification you have to complete all 5 of the [Front End Development Libraries Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries#front-end-development-libraries-projects). The [Random Quote Machine](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine) project is the first project on the list and the leading example of this guide.


## Who is this guide for?

If you're interested in using Elm to build reliable web applications then this guide is for you.

## Prerequisites

There are some basics you should know so that you don't get completely lost while following this guide. You should have:

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
  - I highly recommend the excellent courses provided by [web.dev](https://web.dev/learn).
- Basic knowledge of Elm.
  - The [Elm Guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/) is required reading for any Elm developer.
  - [Beginning Elm](https://elmprogramming.com/) provides a gentle introduction to the Elm programming language.

Beyond that, you will need [grit](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance).
