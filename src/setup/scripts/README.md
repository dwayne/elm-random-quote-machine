## Notes

Give a high-level description of each script in the `bin/` directory.

Explain how you can execute them by using their names because they are on the `PATH`.

Be sure to talk about the preamble I use in every script.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

#
# Usage: ...
#

set -euo pipefail
```

Explain why I use `"${variable:?}"` everywhere. Explain the quotes and the `:?` part.
